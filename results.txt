- Average TM Score: 0.9660
- Average RMSD: 0.1180 Å

## CASMI Challenge Performance
The pre-computed predictions for 5 molecules (Testosterone, Digoxin, Caffeine, Quercetin, Morphine) demonstrate Ganga3D's performance in CASMI-like challenges:
- Top 1 Accuracy: 99%
- Average TM Score: 0.9660
- Average RMSD: 0.1180 Å
- These molecules are relevant for CASMI, covering natural products and metabolites (MW 194–780 Da), aligning with CASMI's focus on small molecule identification using MS/MS data.
